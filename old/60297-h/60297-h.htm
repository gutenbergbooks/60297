  <h2 class='c005'>THE WORLD ABOVE.</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The scene is laid in a shadowy and mystic place
known to the dwellers there as The Darker Realm. It has
been built and burrowed from time immemorial far down
underneath some great, beautiful, sunny, human metropolis,
called The World Above, but of this light-crowned
city those who inhabit the subterranean retreats of The
Darker Realm know but little, of its happy days and
doings they can but dream.</p>

<p class='c007'>The galleries of The Darker Realm are like an interminable
network—one could so easily be lost there!
Some parts are new and are built up smoothly with polished
stone; other parts are old—so old and irregular that
it seems as if they must have been set there many, many
centuries ago. Perhaps the place has been an ancient
mine where dim-eyed people sought the turquoise gem
for their devil-altars; perhaps it was once a human town
over which volcanic ashes and desert sands have fallen
and drifted for many a long century. Unexhumed and
rediscovered, it lies there, and the dwellers in The World
Above find use for the water-way conduits that thread its
interminable passages.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are two persons in the story: Jean, a young
man, a workman in The Darker Realm, and Angelica, a
young maiden, daughter of another workman in the same.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>Scene I.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(A place in The Darker Realm. The background
forms a cave-like enclosure or gallery with an arched roof
composed of massive blocks of fitted stone. At the center
of the enclosure is a tall well-sweep with other gigantic
structures. Chains and tubes range along the walls and
ceiling. At the right there is an opening into one of the
larger conduits, and over the opening a trap-door is held
up diagonally by a long dusty rope with a pulley attaching
it to the wall above. From above this opening dangles
a cord that floats out tensely, showing that a strong current
of air is coming down through the conduit and is
flowing out into the gallery. Near the front a foot-bridge
crosses a gulley in the floor of the passage; one can see
the glint of the water flowing below. At the left, high up
on the wall, juts forth a crane and on this hangs an iron
lantern from which a sickly light is given forth. This is
almost the only center of light in the place, though it is
possible to see that there is some kind of a lamp beyond
the half-open door of a windowless hut which is dimly
perceived at the back of the gallery. Also, above the
foot-bridge, there is a flue in the ceiling, and through this
flows downward a faint, pale light, almost imperceptible,
like the dimmest twilight. At the back of the gallery,
arched openings on either side lead to passages of impenetrable
blackness.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the door of the hut a young girl emerges and
passes across the gallery. She hums a strain of the hymn
Varina, and as she comes along, she touches the wall
lightly with her white finger tips and walks with a hesitating
step as if the floor were slippery, or as if she were
accustomed to find her way more by the sense of touch
than by that of sight. She is a slender and delicate looking
girl, and the pupils of her eyes are large and dark as
if they were trying to gather all the light they could. Her
garment is a poor, dull-colored thing, and her face and
her two hands are the only spots of pure white in the whole
picture. She comes forward slowly, touching the wall
sensitively and sings, as she approaches, in a voice like a
soft, sweet flute, and yet more pathetic than any words
can describe.)</p>

    <div>[<a href="music/010a.mp3">Listen</a>]</div>

<p class='c007'>(She comes forward to the bridge and looks down
into the water.)</p>

    <div>[<a href="music/010b.mp3">Listen</a>]</div>

</div>

<p class='c007'>(She looks up toward the flue; the dim radiance
there falls like a halo upon her head. She whispers:)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—“Saints immortal!” I wonder what “saints
immortal” may be!</p>

<p class='c007'>(She looks around wonderingly and then looks down
at her hand and turns a ring upon her finger, and then
holds it up to the pale light from above, and smiles as she
sings the second line of the stanza.)</p>

  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>[<a href="music/010c.mp3">Listen</a>]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>(Then she turns and takes in long breaths of the air
from the fresh current, lifting her shoulders as if she enjoyed
the mere pleasure of breathing.)</p>

    <div>[<a href="music/010d.mp3">Listen</a>]</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>(She rests her face upon her hand meditatively.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—This air—it must be the “everlasting spring”
that mother sings about, it is so sweet!—for when I ask
mother what “spring” is, she says it is where the air is
fresh and sweet. Ah, yes! I would rather be out here,
rather than in the close room, since mother is so sad and
will not talk with me. Here the air comes rushing down
the conduit and pours out into the gallery and fills me
with such joy that I can scarcely breathe enough of it!
I breathe and breathe it in! But—(she stops, listening,
and holds her hand to her heart) surely, surely that
is Jean’s step! It comes nearer! It turns down the Branch
of Blind Alleys. It is, it is! Jean! Jean! (Then with
an effort to gain composure of tone—) Why, Jean, is that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>you? (A boyish-looking fellow comes forward; he is
dressed in workman’s clothes and has all the marks of
sordid labor upon his frame. His body is muscular but
his complexion shows the pallor that suggests the cellar-grown
plant. His eyes glow, however, with happy expectancy
as he moves swiftly toward Angelica and takes
her hands in his.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Angelica! Do not pretend you did not hear
my step; I saw you listening. I could tell from the very
Court of Miracles what you were thinking of if I saw only
the bend of your head! But look you! I am here! Jean!
It is Jean!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I know. (She turns and seems to make
up her mind to throw all ruse aside; with a gesture of
welcome she cries:) Ah, I thought I was never to see you
again!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I thought so, too. I have wished to see you!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Why, then, were you so long?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I was working with old Jacques over in the
Old Freestone Branch beyond the Court of Miracles.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(She shudders.) The Old Freestone? O,
why did you go there?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Some one must go, Angelica, and I was the
youngest and strongest. If I had not gone, old Jacques
would have had to as he was the only one that understood
the buttressing of the ancient wall, and I wouldn’t have
had old Jacques made to go for worlds!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—No indeed, old Jacques that saved your
life and pulled you out of the Great River!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, dear old fellow! And it’s dangerous
over there. You know they made the walls of the Old
Freestone Branch out of blocks of stone so large that
when a break starts and they begin to fall, it is not safe
to be working among them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes, I know; Didon was lost there. Ah,
poor Didon!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, alas! But do not think of Didon; think
of me! I am here again! I came to see you!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But not for so long, for so long! And all
the time I feared and wondered what I should do if you
should fall from a bridge into the water, or should be
caught beneath a break, or should have illness, or should
get drawn into the quicksands.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Ah, do not think of these things! Think
only of the pleasant side! Think that we are together!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span><i>Angelica</i>—But how can I think of this when I remember
that any moment you may be snatched away
from me and I never see you again! Do you not remember
how when a stone in the wall crumbled away and a
rivulet burst into the new tunnel that the Triangle Branch
men were working on, and you with them, how the rivulet
all in a moment swelled into a stream that rushed forward
with a roar we could hear away here, and how it
tore down walls and bridges and air flues in its course,
and how you nearly got caught in it? You barely escaped,
Jean!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, I know it, Angelica.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And ah, if you should fall beneath a break,
or get caught in a quicksand, if you should leave us quite
alone, mother and me! Wild terror comes over me every
time I try to think it out.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Do not try to think it out, dear Angelica. Put
your hand on my arm. Feel how strong it is! I shall
work for you.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Now that father is gone, I may need to
have you work for me.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Your father gone? Where?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Three days now he has not come home.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But he will surely come.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes, if he be not caught in a break!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Well, if he comes not, I shall still be here,
strong and loving.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Timidly) Loving?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, loving; why not? Have I not always
been loving? From the first day I ever came into the
Great River Branch and pushed my tool-cart along with
old Jacques and saw you sitting there on the doorstep of
your hut, saw you there but a minute when your mother
called you in because she heard strange voices outside and
the jingle of tools,—from that day have I not loved you
and thought of you as my most sacred dream?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Clasping her hands) Have you, oh have
you? Have I been to you like a dream?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—And did you not think of me at all? Do
you not remember that day too?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I do not remember that day, I think, but
I remember other days. I remember when we played together
down where the Branch of Blind Alleys juts into
the Great River Gallery. I had caught a little lizard and
kept it to play with and called it Prince, and along came
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>Didon, heedless, cruel Didon, and he gave my poor
Prince one knock on the head. What is a lizard? he
cried, and you—do you remember what you did?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Well, what I did was to give Didon a good
thrashing. I beat him well and he deserved it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Sighing) Ah, poor Didon!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Do not say “poor Didon.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But alas, he suffered and lost his life in
the War, and all because of my Prince, my poor little
dead lizard. Yes, that was really the cause of the war,
wasn’t it? The Blind Alley men taking up my side and
the Triangle men and the Great River men on his, and
then the fight going on and taking in other Branches besides.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—So we got tired of the lizard-play!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—We did indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yet it was good play while it lasted, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes, it was good play while it lasted, but
I have noticed that the things we play with get so after
awhile that we do not care to play with them anymore.
Have you noticed that?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, I never did; but then, you are the great
noticer.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But I think you are!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Well, out of our lizard-play came the war,
which went on——</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Until the Break!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, the Great Break when the wall fell in
and poor Didon was crushed under the toppled mason-work.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—That made all our wars seem useless and
small, didn’t it? But do you think that the great pressure
of the crowd of boys and men from the Branch of Blind
Alleys that took up your side and fought with Didon’s
crew, made the gallery wall cave in? Or did it just cave
in of itself?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—How can I tell? It may have been either, or
both. The walls are always falling in the Old Freestone
galleries.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—It is this never knowing the causes of
things that worries me! Now when the water began to
flow right in to the top of the Main Cross Tunnel and all the
men were so frightened by that, as if the whole Darker
Realm were to come to an end, why were they so much
more frightened than usual? And I overheard them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>talking about a diver going down from above. Now if
a diver was to go down from above to stop the hole,
where was he to dive from?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—O, the explanation of all that is easy enough.
I think there must have been a river above there and a
bridge.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—A bridge? (in astonishment) a bridge
above there? A bridge like this one I am standing on?
Are there bridges above us? Is there a world above with
bridges and galleries and air-conduits and lizards and
lizard-wars and—and breaks?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Laughing) O no! I am certain that if
there were a world above, there wouldn’t be any wars
and breaks in it!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I am sure I don’t see how you know that.
You can’t imagine anything else for the people to do but
roll tool-cars, clean pipes, and repair breaks, can you?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I can’t imagine it, no; but I am sure if there
were a world above it would not be so sad and dark as this.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Dark? What does that mean?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Isn’t this The Darker Realm?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Oh! I see! And yet I am not sure that I
<i>do</i> see!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Why, dark is everything that isn’t light,
everything that isn’t lamps and cressets, everything that
isn’t your face, everything that isn’t you! If there’d
been a world above, you’d have been in it, not here!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(With enthusiasm) Ah, I wish I had!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(In a surly voice) I don’t.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Why not?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Because I want you here—here with me!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Oh, yes, that!—but if we both could go
to The World Above?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Don’t talk such nonsense; of course there
isn’t any such thing, and what’s the use of bothering our
heads with puzzling and wondering?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes, that’s just it, wondering! I can’t
help wondering. There’s something in my head that goes
on wondering and wondering. My wondering-machine
will keep going, and I cannot stop it. It makes me very
unhappy and yet I do not wholly want it to stand still.
Now, I can’t help wondering what these fearful things
mean, these breaks. Do you never wonder?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Wonder? No. I wonder at nothing. I don’t
see anything to wonder at.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span><i>Angelica</i>—Now, I wonder all the time. I want to
know the meanings of things. What makes this water
flow, what makes the lamp burn, who made this cloth of
my dress, these walls and foot-paths, the cressets and windlasses
and charcoal-burners. I asked mother if she made
the cloth and she said “no.” I said, “who did?” She said,
“how should I know?” I said, “where did it come from?”
She said, “Father brought it.” “Where did he get it,” I said.
She said, “I didn’t ask him,”—and not a word more would
she say. Where do my dresses come from, this cloth-stuff,
do you know? Do they not come from The World Above?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Why, no. They just come from your mother.
She sews them for you. And the stone in your precious
ring, that Jacques calls an opal, do you know where it
came from?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Eagerly) From The World Above?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Very impatiently) Oh, no! <i>I</i> gave it to you.
It came from me. I loved you and I gave it to you.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But where did <i>you</i> get it?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I found it in the Court of Miracles at the edge
of the Great Pool, of course, where we are always finding
things. We never found anything that was not found
there, of course, for that is the Great Place-of-Finding-Things.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Do you believe that?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Believe what? That this is the Great Place-of-Finding-Things?
Why, of course! How can you keep
from believing what you feel with your very own hands
and hear with your own ears? When I took hold of the
scoop something slipped over the handle and I felt a little
knob-like thing go between my fingers. I caught at it
and cleaned away what was tangled around it and gave
it to you.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And I washed it and washed it and washed
it, and made it clean, quite clean, and lo, it was a ring
just right for my finger, for my finger, finger, finger!
(She flourishes her hand joyously with the ring upon it.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Let me see it again; let me take it and look at
it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Oh, you cannot take it! I cannot be
without it one moment, I love it so.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But let me, me only, look at it one moment.
(He snatches at her hand and draws it to him and kisses
it impulsively.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I thought you wanted to look at the ring!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span><i>Jean</i>—I forget the ring when I think of you, dearest
Angelica. Can’t you forgive that? Can’t you? Can’t
you?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I would try, perhaps; but now, look at it!
look! (She holds up the ring to the lamp’s light.) See
the wonders in it?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I see no wonders; it is just a little round drop
of dull white set on a band of gold.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Little round drop of dull white indeed!
See there! See there! Do you not see a streak of something,
like the pain that now and then shoots down
through one’s shoulders?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, there is no streak in it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But now, <i>now</i>, see it! Try it in this light,
in this pale, pure light that shines down through the flue
from above.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Ah, yes, I do see it now; now that you hold it
in the light of the flue, I see it; now, a darting of red!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Of red? What is red?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—O wonderful eyes!—Don’t you know that red
is a color?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—A color? What is a color?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Why, a color is—is, well, for instance, red;
look at it!—<i>that</i> is a color.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But it changes. Is that, now—see!—is
that a color too? Can you not catch the other dartings?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, I see; that is blue; yes, that is a color,
too. Now I can see yellow, orange and purple; these
are the colors; all the colors there are, are here.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—How do you know, now, that they are all
the colors there are?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I know because these are all the colors I have
ever seen, and of course, then, they are all there are.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But how did they come there? What put
the dartings in there? What are they for?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Come there? What for? What silly questions!
Why, this is an opal, and it is the nature of opals to have
these colors in them and to dart about in this way.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And are these beautiful colors to be seen
only in the opal?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Of course, where else should one see them?
Did you ever see them anywhere else, child?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—No, I never did, but I thought perhaps
you might, since you have traveled so far, so far beyond
the Great Cloaca Branch and the Branch of Blind Alleys
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>and even beyond the Great Cross. (She holds the opal
in the light and turns and turns it.) It seems to me that
I dimly perceive other dartings than these you have
named, although perhaps I am mistaken. But it is very
beautiful and I love it. (A pause.) Well, well, it is all a
mystery, I see I must have a new pair of eyes or a new
sense of some kind to know all about this wonderful thing
you call color. (Brightening) But I know I shall have
them some day, else why did I get the opal and how was
it that I found the shooting, pain-like rays in my opal?
Jean, if I had made the world, I would have made it all
opals! I wish I <i>could</i> make a world! O, but everything
should be beautiful if I could make life!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Patronizingly and coaxingly) Make life?
What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Why, make life, make things and people!
Oh, if I could but make things and people!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I don’t see what you could do with them when
you made them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Oh, I would have them live and laugh
and have lights, lights, all they wanted of lights!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But what for?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Oh, because I love people and I love
lights. I could never have too many lights. Oh, how I
love them! When I wake up from a long sleep and see
that mother has set the lamp a-burning I could shout for
joy. Then if I had lights enough, I know I would not
have to bring my opal out to the bridge to make it throw
forth all its dartings. If I could make a world, I would
have things very different from this.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Should I be there?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Oh, yes, you would be there but (with just
a little touch of coquetry) I should not pay much attention
to you. (Seriously) I should be so busy looking
around at all the beautiful opal-colored things. Now for
myself I would have a skirt of red and a sacque of blue
and the walls of my hut should be covered with red and
purple all swaying and melting as in the ring, and I would
have the shades that sweep from color to color, the softest
for my ceiling and beneath my feet the richest and warmest.
Thus should my world have been, had I made the
world!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Do not worry your mind with these visions
and wonderings, dearest Angelica. You will become so excited
you will be ill, dear.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span><i>Angelica</i>—Oh no, I shall not be ill, I shall be well!
It makes me almost believe that there is such a world
above when I think of how well I could be if I were in it.
For, why did I have eyes that long for light, light, more
light, if I was never to have more light?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Dear Angelica! (soothingly.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—No, no, do not speak against it! I know
there <i>is</i> a world above. I know it. I feel it. O, let us
go there! Let us go up through this flue and find it!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Why, Angelica, if there had been such a thing,
your mother would have told you and old Jacques would
surely have known about it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Then I shall ask mother,—and now! For
I feel that I cannot wait; I must know. I shall ask mother;
I shall make her tell.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—And shall I go and ask old Jacques?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Do you do so, and come to tell me again.
Come here in an hour, here to the Bridge. Good bye,
Jean! Good bye! We must find The World Above!</p>

<p class='c007'>(Jean watches Angelica go into the hut and then
passes slowly across the gallery and disappears in one of
the Blind Alleys.)</p>

  <h3 class='c008'>Scene II.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(Another part of the Darker Realm. The walls are
of long blocks of stone set irregularly together; gigantic
fungi grow in distorted protrusions from the interstices,
and water drips from their outreaching fantastic fingers.
The blackness of darkness shows in portals opening on
various passages. Some disused tool carts and heaps of
debris are piled up at the side. A flaming torch in a
cresset gives an irregular and eerie light like flashes of
blue lightning. The tracks for tool carts pass along the
floor of the tunnel. The sound of water flowing in some
under-ground channel is heard. Jean and Angelica enter
from opposite sides and meet.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span><i>Angelica</i>—O Jean, O Jean! What I have seen!
What have I seen!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—What, what? How came you here, Angelica?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I was impatient to see you and so I came
to meet you and on the way—O, I saw, I saw—what
do you think?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I cannot guess. Here, come and rest yourself;
sit here and do not tremble so. (He leads her to a
seat on a broken bench.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I saw—(clasping her hands in ecstacy) a
saint immortal!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Saint immortal,—what is that?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—A saint immortal? Do you not know?
Why, that is one of the happy beings that live in the world
above! Mother sings about it, you know: “Where saints
immortal reign,” she sings. That’s in the “land of pure
delight.”</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Dear Angelica! Never mind about that now.
Come, rest awhile and get over this excitement. Let us
talk about our childhood and the happy days we spent
together playing around the well-sweep in the Blind
Alleys and the games and that poor Prince and all the—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Jean, are you crazy?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, (laughing) but I think you are, talking
about saints immortal and The World Above and all
those impossible dreams of yours.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But now, listen! (She lays her hand on
his arm.) As I was coming from our hut—have I told you
what mother said? and—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Why, no, you have not yet. I think you were
going to, but—tell me about your vision, if you want to,
first.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And what did old Jacques say? I am
sure he said exactly what mother did when I crowded her
down to it, that there <i>is</i>—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Sadly) I couldn’t find old Jacques. He
may have gone off to your world above, for anything I
know (sarcastically).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—O Jean, do not be so hard of heart! Let
me tell you! Do you know, I found mother singing that
song she loves so to sing——</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Laughing) Well, what has that to do with
the matter?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Why, it’s all about The World Above, the
song itself is about that. Listen! (She sings.)</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—It is a beautiful song, dear.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes, Jean, (she speaks most solemnly)
Mother says there <i>is</i> a world above this, that there really
is; and now, it may be old Jacques has gone there, and if
he has, I am sure I am very glad, for up there everything
is beautiful and colored with all the colors in this opal,
and everybody is happy there.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Very sadly) Angelica, do you really believe
all this?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I did believe it before, and now I know it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—And does it make you glad to believe it?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes (with a long ecstatic breathing); but
if you believed it, I should be all the more certain of it,
and if the belief made you glad, it would make me all
the more glad.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But why, then, if your mother knew about
this, did she not tell you before? Why did she not talk
with you about it?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Ah, Jean, that was the first thing I said.
I don’t like to tell you what she answered.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But tell me; for am I not the same as yourself?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—She said she had not told me because—because—she
was afraid I would fret to go there, and she
did not want me to, she wanted me to be content to stay
here with her. Besides, she said, it might make me blind
to go there—I do not know why. But now father has
gone; three days he has been gone; such a thing never happened
before, and mother fears he has gone to The World
Above and will never come back.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—He will, of course,—unless—unless—a break
in some blind alley has caught him!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Do not frighten me! That cannot be. I
will not believe it. He has gone to The World Above
and I am glad he has!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span><i>Jean</i>—But now, Angelica, if there were a world
above, how did we happen to be in The Darker Realm,
instead of in that one? We must have come from that
world to this?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Oh! Think of that! (She clasps her
hands in an ecstacy.) And do you remember ought
about it, dear Jean?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Very sadly.) I only remember old Jacques.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I, at any rate, must have come from some
world above, for I think I remember, or rather, I feel
dimly a remembering like to a faint breathing as sweet
as an—as an “everlasting spring,” Jean. (Angelica sits
musing and Jean gazes upon her. A pause. Then he
says, tenderly:)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But why don’t you tell me what it was you
saw?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Starting up again excitedly) O, words
could not tell it! Jean, heart of man could not dream of
the wonder of it!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But what was it? What was it, to deserve all
this?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I’ll try to tell. As I came by the Little
Cross of Miracles, I looked up through the flue and at the
top I saw that there was an opening—an opening out,
Jean! At first I could not look, it pierced and pricked
my eyes like sharpest knives; but after a while, I had
to look; and through the opening I saw a face, a face,
Jean!—the face of a maiden like myself, with eyes looking
down at me with looks of curiosity, and oh, Jean!—of love;
and they shone like lamps! But her hair looked like the
gold of my ring, and around her neck her dress was like
the red dartings in the opal; and then, oh, she looked
down with a gaze that turned from curiosity and love to
sorrow and almost to horror! And then she moved back
and went away! Yet, as she arose, I saw her form for
one brief moment. Her movements were like the shadows
of the light upon the water where it flows beneath the
bridge by our hut in the Court of Blind Alleys. And all
the colors of the opal were upon her and around her, and
beyond her a most clear and shining blue, that dazzled
and hurt my eyes so that I could not look upon it at all.
And I saw a wall, not dark like these around here, but
colored like the opal when it is asleep; and there were
things like these (laying her hand on one of the outreaching
fungi), only finer and all in masses, much more beautiful
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>and of a color like—but I cannot tell you what it was
like; it was like nothing that we have here, but it was soft
and comforting. I could have looked at it always, and
never I am sure would I have had to rest my eyes for
aching. (Turning suddenly to Jean) Do you not believe
it now?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—What, that this vision of yours was anything
but a dream?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—When you, dear dreamer, are always dreaming?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But what, then, was that beautiful creature
that I saw above the open trap? Was she not one
of the “saints immortal” mother sings about?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—What was it? O, that was a vision, a something
that passed across your eye-balls, a sort of defect
in your sight.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Ah, that will not do, you cannot explain
it in that way, you cannot, you cannot!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, this is how it is. Listen, dear! You
know the shadows of the swinging lamp as they reflect on
the water and then back on the glass above, make just
such strange pictures. We have often watched them together.
Don’t you remember, dear, once when—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But the trap was open and above I saw a
sheet of jewel like my ring when I hold it up to the candle,
and at the side I saw a wall but clearer and brighter than
any wall in all The Darker Realm. It fairly glistened.
Tell me, have you never seen such a vision in all your
life?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, dear Angelica.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Nor ever seen any opening above that
seemed to lead out into a place far brighter and more
beautiful than this?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, dearest Angelica.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And did you never in all your travels from
one part of The Darker Realm to another, did you never
find a gallery that seemed to lead outward?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, dearest.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And did you never have a sort of feeling
within that there must be a world above, to account for
this in fact,—to account for ourselves if for no other reason?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—What kind of a queer feeling might that be?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Well, let me see, how can I tell you!
Perhaps something like this. Have you ever lost your
way?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span><i>Jean</i>—Oh, no, that is, not many times—only once.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Well, what did you do?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I considered.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—You considered? What good did that do?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Why, I considered where I was and that I
came from the direction I came from, and so I turned and
went back in that direction; and when I came to the point
where I turned down, then I turned, and when I had gone
as far as I did in coming, then I stopped again and considered
and decided which way to take, and so I simply
decided at each step and pretty soon I was at the Great
Cross and then I knew the way like my own fingers.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But I, when I was lost, stopped and listened,
and in my soul I heard a Voice telling me to go this
way to the right, and pretty soon to stop and turn off and
so I turned off, and by and by I heard the voice again
saying, “stop and turn;” and again, “now to the right” and
then; “turn down the little way;” and then at last, “turn by
the wheel;” and then I reached the Great Cross; and so
I crept along, listening all the way, and at last reached
our hut.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Now what might that Voice be?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Jean, I do not know; but I have sometimes
thought—don’t laugh!—but I have sometimes thought
the Voice came from this wonderful ring of mine; at any
rate, when I do what the Voice says, the opal glows out so
in the dark that I cannot keep from singing.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But suppose you do not do what the Voice
says?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Then the ring fades down as if it were
disappointed and saddened.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Angelica, you are a wonderful dreamer. But
I don’t really see much difference between your way and
mine, only that what you call the Voice, I call considering.
That’s all the difference.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—O no, but there is a great deal more difference
than just that, for I heard other voices too. Do you
never hear voices?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, never! Never heard a one.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Never heard your mother’s voice?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Mother’s? No. I was too little when she
disappeared anyway; I never knew anything about her.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Well, old Jacques, then; he has been like
a mother to you. Do you never hear him when you are
far away in the galleries and the light has gone out and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>you don’t know the way—do you never hear him calling,
or rather not exactly calling, but sort o’ pulling and drawing
you in your soul as if you had to move toward him
and reach him somehow?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—O, yes, once I remember—when I had to stay
all night in the Triangle Branch. I had no cot to lie on
but only just a bench and it was very hard and I wanted
old Jacques very much and I seemed, I think I seemed to
feel—what you call—a “pulling” then. I was very cross
I know and I—cried.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Laughing) Of course, for you were a
very little boy. It may be you felt a pulling then, but I
think (hesitatingly) it was just homesickness,—just homesickness,
Jean. (With a long sigh) I am afraid I can’t
make you understand what I mean by pulling. But
(more cheerfully) you’ll understand sometime.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—When shall I understand, Angelica?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—O, when we are in The World Above!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Laughing) Angelica, I see there is no use
trying to teach you sense!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Jean, I see there is no use trying to make
you see the truth! And as long as you laugh at me, of
course I cannot tell you what I in my inmost soul have
thought.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Come then, (condescendingly,) I will not laugh,
dear child!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Pouting) No, that will not do, either!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—How, then?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Why, lovingly—(she pauses).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—You did not mean to say that? Then say it
now and mean it! Dear one, why be so shy of me? I
love you and always have loved you; you know it! You
love me,—it must be so. Let us enjoy it. What else
have we worth talking of in all The Darker Realm? Come,
tell me!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes, dear Jean, I am listening.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—And with all the loving that lives and burns
in me, I will listen to everything you have in your heart.
If it is your thought, I love it, no matter what it is.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Then listen, listen with the heart! (She
seats herself more comfortably by his side and raising her
forefinger to enforce what she says, begins.) When I have
stood on the bridge in the Center of Blind Alleys and gazed
down into the water that flows and flows so black and
ceaselessly below, I have seen—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span><i>Jean</i>—Well, what then? Some of your visions, with
robes of red and hair of gold color, and walls of opal?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—There, now! You said you would listen
believingly!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I will, I will! My heart is here.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But I want head, too.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Teasingly grasping one! You want too much.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—With solemnity even this you must give, if
you hear my story. I feel that you can not understand my
story unless you give both!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Both, all, anything; they are yours, Angelica!
Tell me about these visions upon the flowing water.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Shadows seemed to fall there, of all shapes
and forms.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Is that all? And was this puzzling to you?
I can explain it all. Now, these shadows were, of course,
the reflection from the cresset-light, that fell upon the
water and then flew back again to your dear little eyes;
that was all. Do you see, dear?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But that was not all. There was more of it!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—What, then?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Once when I was standing and watching,
there came a sudden change; the cresset-light went out!
I looked and it was as black on the wall as the quicksand
pond in the Court of Miracles. Then I looked down to
the water again. The light from the flue came down a
little less dimly than it did when the cresset was burning,
and in a minute, dearest Jean, the self-same shadows began
to flicker and fall and pass like the faint images of
many graceful beings moving very swiftly to and fro
above. I turned as cold as any stone when I saw this!
Aha, that vision you cannot explain!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But, dear, I can. These were still reflections,
the cresset reflections that had been, as it were, left over.
They were tossed down to the moving water, from the
water they were tossed up into the flue, and when the light
in the cresset went out, these that were stored in the flue
had still to fall.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But this went on and on; this kept going
on!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Then there were a great many left over to fall,
a sort of accumulation of them.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—That sounds well, and it may be so, yet
it does not fully satisfy me. And there is something else!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—More wonders?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><i>Angelica</i>—Yes; listen with heart and head; you know
you promised.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I will keep my promise, dear love.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—You hear this roar?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Of course, the water in the Great River, you
mean?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes, Jean. (She draws nearer and speaks
very low) Jean, I have heard another roar!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Then there I am with you. I have, too; in
fact, I have heard many kinds of roars. The river has a
very different sound from the Chain Tube and the Chain
Tube from the conduit in the Rubble Corridor and each
air-passage has a sound of its own. Of course you could
not be expected to have learned this, but they are common
facts known to all that study into the laws and systems
of The Darker Realm in which we live.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yes, I, too, have ears and I know all the
tones and voices of all the conduits that pass through this
part of The Darker Realm. But this roar that I mean is
different from them all. It is as different as your voice is
from mine. It is more dim and fine than any common
roar; yet there are many, many tones mingled in it—oh,
more than you could ever count! And they are different
kinds of sounds, yet all blending into one. O, it stands
alone, it is quite unlike any other sound in all our galleries.
And when I stand on the bridge by the door of the air-conduit,
and drink in the good air that makes me feel
strong and that mother says I must breathe all I can of
because what she calls “everlasting spring” abides in it, then
it is I hear it. But I do not always hear it even there.
It has times and seasons. Sometimes it twines in with
the roar in the air-conduit and sometimes not. I can now
almost tell when it will begin and when it will end. But,
Jean, the strange thing about it is this: when I go away
from the sound of the water in the Great River, this roar
grows more clear; in fact, the farther I go, the more plainly
I hear this strange spirit-like, tumultuous, sound. Therefore,
it cannot be the rushing of the water or of the air
that causes it. It is something quite distinct and unaccounted
for by anything in our Realm. You can say
nothing to this!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Sadly) Nothing, dear, except that I have
not the fine sense that sees all this and therefore I cannot
dream your dreams with you. But if you believe them
and they make you happy, I am glad for you.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span><i>Angelica</i>—But tell me, have you never seen one single
vision? Nor heard the soft-sounding roar from above?
Nor caught a glimpse of the shadows in the dim radiance
of the flue?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, no, none of all these things.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And when you have looked down from
the bridge into the aqueduct and have seen the water flowing,
flowing, have you not asked yourself whence it comes,
and whither it is going? And also why it flows,—ever
flows? And have you not longed to go on with it and follow
it in its current until you found out where it was going
to? Following the way the water flows, would not that
lead us to some explanation of what it all means?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But what is the use, beloved Angelica, of our
bothering our heads with these questions when it is plainly
impossible to find any answers whatever?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I cannot help it. I <i>must</i> bother my head!
O, have you never in all your travels seen anything, anything,
like an opening outward?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, love; yet that I may not be quite outdone
by you in telling about wonders, I will tell you of something
that happened to me once, in which I dare say you,
if it had happened to you, might have found a dream of
The World Above.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Ah, tell me, tell me!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Do not expect too much. It was only this.
I remember that once when I was down on what they call
the Grand Canal, I there saw something that I at any rate
could not understand. I saw a dim light in the center
of the tunnel and as I drew nearer it grew greater and
greater until it shone so that it seemed to shoot sharp
knives into my eyes. I could not bear the pain and so I
turned back. You, I suppose, would have rushed forward
and gazed upon it and spoiled your eyesight forever
and never have been able to see anything in our Darker
Realm again.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Excitedly) It was an opening. It was,
it was! Lead me there, take me there! O take me there
at once!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—It is not for a moment to be thought of! Not
for you, dear. It is far away, and the new breaks are all
down on that side, and you are not strong enough to attempt
it. And you could not look upon it; you know
your mother said so. She told you it would make you
blind.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span><i>Angelica</i>—Ah, I do not care! Let me go! I am
strong; let me go! I will risk the eyes!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—If you bid me I will go and see whether I can
find it again; but you—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Jean, you do not know how strong I am.
I have done as mother bade me; I have breathed in the
breath of the everlasting spring, and I am strong enough
to go. Mother would let me—I would <i>make</i> her let me go!
And we would then come and tell her! Ah, let me go and
see at least if that gallery is still open and if—in case we
wished to—we could go by that way to The World Above.
Come, come, dear Jean, will you come? (She draws
Jean to his feet and pulls him excitedly on.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But, Angelica—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Come, come! In what direction is it?
Only tell me that!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I have forgotten exactly where it was, but it
was down the Grand Canal and beyond the Great Cross;
it is likely that it was some strange affliction of my eyes
that seized me; only that, dear Angelica!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—No, no; we must try to find it. We must
at least go there and have one look outward. (With determination)
Jean, if you do not come with me, I shall
go alone, and I shall wander till I find.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, no, dear! Never think of doing such a
thing!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I shall! I am going now! (She flies
along the passage, and then stops and gazes back upon
Jean. She looks like a spirit shining out in the darkness).
Are you coming? I am going on!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Then go on, Angelica; I will come with you.
I am coming, I am coming! (Both figures pass under the
arch of masonry fringed with its grotesque fungi, and disappear
into the black darkness).</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>
  <h3 class='c008'>Scene III.</h3>
</div>

<p class='c009'>(A spacious gallery in The Darker Realm, where a
gateway opens out and lets in a flood of dazzling light.
Graceful vines entwine the arch and move quietly in the
wind, while beyond the opening spreads the blue and
glittering surface of a river. Many gay-colored river-crafts
ply up and down in the distance, and the varied
sounds of city life send a pleasant murmur to the ear.
Beyond all are banks of green, church spires, and a strip
of sky that is ripening in color toward sunset. Beneath
the arch at the right, steps of stone masonry lead down
into the waters and disappear in the transparent depths; a
stone foot-path leads from the left along the side of the
gallery, and the walls are trellised here and there with
little trailing fingers of moss. Jean and Angelica enter
from the dark gallery and follow along the embanked
stone foot-path. Angelica moves as though her physical
strength were exhausted while Jean supports her form
and seems to urge her forward.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span><i>Jean</i>—Dear Angelica, come but a little farther!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I can go no farther; I am breathless; I
am faint.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Ah, yes, bear up, dear; lean on me.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—My eyes, my eyes!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Close your eyes for awhile; I will lead you.
Then when they are rested, you can open them and look
through the gateway. Now we have come so far and
suffered so much, you must not lose the sight you have
so longed to see.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—The stones are more slimy, more slippery,
at every step.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But let me lead you; take my hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(She reaches out uncertainly and instead
of touching his hand, touches the masonry of stone.) The
wall! (A shudder passes over her.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Here, dear! (He clasps her arm and draws her
hand away from the wall.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—My eyes have prickles in them; I can
scarcely see. When I look at that great red eye before
us yonder, a thousand points jut out and fly to me and hit
me in my eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But that great red eye must be the opening,
dear. That is where we reach The World Above.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Then I do not want to reach The World
Above, for nothing but pain comes to me from that great
red eye.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But I feel certain that we must go through that
opening and when we get there I am sure that we shall
scarcely know that we are coming into light. My eyes
are quite used to it now, at least so that they do not prickle
any more, and I can make out some beautiful things.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—What? Tell me what, for I shall never
see it myself.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, you will. Believe me, it is only a little
further, only a little more weariness and pain and we shall
be there. When I saw what you were willing to go through
to reach this gateway, what suffering to endure, what
dangers to risk, I began to believe with you, and now we
have our reward, for here we are with the gate right at
hand.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But I am too tired!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Then let us rest here a little before we take
the last steps, and let us get our eyes used to the opaline
lights. And see, we have much more light now; I can see
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>you better, and you could see me better if you would but
take your hand down from your eyes and look at me.
(She slowly looks around and bends her eyes upon him.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I cannot see you at all. Oh, where are
you? Have you left me alone?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, dear, no! Here I am, by your side.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Am I turned blind?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—O, no, it was because your eyes had rested for
a moment on the light of the gateway and when you
turned to me you could not bear the contrast of the darkness.
But look and see! In this new light can you not
see me better?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I—see—you—better. (She slowly draws
back with a frightened look in her eyes) I never saw you
look like that!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I never saw you look so beautiful, Angelica.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I never saw you look so—like this. O,
who is this? Who are you? (almost crying) Where is
my Jean?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Why, what is the matter? I am Jean! Put
your hand on my face and you will find that I am Jean,
just the same as always. (She lays her delicate hand on
his brow and draws it down over his eyes and lips, then
draws it away with a long sigh and closes her eyes; he
snatches her hand back and kisses it passionately.) Ah,
Aho is it now? (breathlessly.) Is it Jean, or is it not
Jean?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—It is Jean that kissed me. It is not Jean
that my eyes rest on. Your face has a thousand things in
it that I never saw before. There are lines and wrinkles
and furrows; there are shadows and shrinkings; there are
marks and scars; there are pains and miseries. I did not
know you were so sad and burdened and broken-hearted
and miserable, and—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—O what, O what?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Is there shame? Are you ashamed of
something? Have you done something wicked, some
dreadful, dreadful wickedness?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—O, when you look at me, Angelica, I am full of
shame. I am crushed to the stones with shame. Do not
look at me so, I cannot bear it. (He covers his face with
his hands).</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But, yes, I must look at you; I must know
this face, sad and furrowed as it is. Take away your
hands; let me see your eyes!</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span><i>Jean</i>—Then see, and I will tell you why your look
pains me to the heart and why I cannot lift my eyes to
yours. When I was—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Hush! (She speaks imperatively and puts
her hand over his mouth but he pulls it away.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But why? You wanted to know, and now I
want to tell you; I will tell you every bad thing I ever did!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—No, no, no, no! I will not hear! I will
stop my ears. I do not want to hear. Not a word, not
a word!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But it is the truth and I want you to know the
truth, all the truth.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I know the truth, I see the truth in your
face, all of the truth that I want to know; I see it in the
lines and shadows beneath your eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But if I do not tell you more, you will find it
out yourself and then you will not love me!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Telling or not telling will not change my
love. I have loved you—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—<i>Have</i> loved me!—</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I have begun to love you. Love for you
has begun in my heart, and what is begun must go on.
You are you! I see it in the light from the great eye
of The World Above, and if you are you, what matters
anything you or all the people in The World Above could
tell me? You are you, that is enough!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But is it better to know that I am I, though
my face or even the whole of me changes, is it better to
know this than to know anything else in the world? Is it
better? Is it? O let me hear you say!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(She laughs a soft laugh of contentment;)
It is so! It is better!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—You are you, and I am I, and we are together,
together, together! (She throws her arms around his
neck and lets her head rest against his. He draws her
close to his side. Then they rest for a long time in quiet
and finally she turns and looks again toward the light at
the opening of the gallery.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Whispering.) The light! I cannot look
upon it, but I know it is the light!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Softly). Yes, dear, it is the light from The
World Above, shining in on us as we sit here together.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Whispering.) Together! Shall we be
always together?</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span><i>Jean</i>—Always, dear, so long as you are you and I
am I!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And shall you be always you?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Always, dear. I cannot be otherwise than
myself, can I? (Laughing a little.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Of course not. I knew that always. I
knew that from the beginning.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—No, you didn’t; you never knew it till I proved
it to you, proved it by the light from The World Above
that shone upon our faces.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Laughing joyously.) I cannot tell you
anything because you always prove things out, can I?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—(Laughing in his turn.) I cannot tell you
anything because you always know without any proving,
don’t you? But are you ready now to try to reach the
gateway? Shall I lift you, dear? Shall we go on?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—But I am so tired. It was such a long way
we came. I would fain stay here always with your arms
around me. I do not care if we never reach The World
Above!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But if we go on, you will still have me with you
and have The World Above besides!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—And the light!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, and the light! You know how you loved
that and how you have longed for it.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Yet when I look at it I shrink back—if
that great eye that shoots out terrors toward me and gives
me more pain than joy be really the light I have longed for!
Ah, Mother! She said the light of The World Above
would blind my eyes. Dear Mother! I want her!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But if we should try to go back, we could not
find our way to her now. We must go on. We will wait
till our eyes are a little stronger and can bear the light; for
it is the light! It must be, since we have traced it by every
trap we have passed. Every one was larger than the
one before, you know, but it was always the same
thing, always something we knew by our eyes. This one
before us is only a light larger and clearer than any of the
others; only that, a larger light than a candle, larger than
a lantern, larger than any of the traps that let down light
from above into The Darker Realm.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I am sure it is as you say, dear Jean, and
perhaps when we have passed through the gateway and
are really in the light, in the light itself, with light, light,
light, pouring around us and bathing us on every side—</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span><i>Jean</i>—Yes, perhaps when we are in the very midst
of it, it won’t hurt our eyes so much.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Beautiful—most beautiful! And perhaps
we shall be a part of it, one with it, and responding to it.
Then, if that were so, it could not hurt us but we should
revel in it, as I being a part of you, dear, take joy in you.
Could that be so, do you think?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—When you say it, dearest, I am sure of it, for
you yourself are light, you shine so! (embracing her.)
May I lift you now and shall we go on? (Jean supports
Angelica on his arm and tenderly leads her on. The two
approach the steps where they lead down into the water.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Must we go through all this, do you think,
before we can be in The World Above?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I believe so, dearest, yes. Are you not rested
a little?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—O yes, I feel much stronger! And you
are with me! That is enough! Hark! Listen, Jean!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Yes, dearest.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—I hear voices, happy voices! Ah, beautiful
voices! Look, Jean, and tell what it is!</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I see many people; they are coming in boats.
They come very near, and they look this way most
pleasantly.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—(Whispering) Are they the “saints immortal”?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—I think they must be, dearest Angelica.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Oh, Jean, dearest, dearest Jean! (A
pause.) Stay with me, Jean! (She puts one arm about
Jean’s neck and rests her face down, covering her eyes
from the light.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Angelica, love, cling to me and I will buoy
you and lead you. (They touch their feet to the water’s
edge.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—The water! (She says it breathlessly.)
Must we step in?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—But look onward, onward, beloved! (They
slowly move down the steps into the water. Jean clings
to the stone buttress and supports Angelica.)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—The water is deeper. (She shrinks back
terrified.) I feel a something drawing my feet, drawing
me away from you. O, where are you, Jean? (She
reaches out her arms and moves them blindly. Jean, in
the utmost tenderness, brings them to his neck.)</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span><i>Jean</i>—Here I am, dear! If you cannot see as they
see in the light of The World Above, you can still know
that it is I, even by the self-same way you knew me in The
Darker Realm. Put your hand on my face, if the light
blinds your eyes, and then you will know.</p>

<p class='c007'>(She lays her hand lightly on his brow. Then with a
long sigh of bliss:)</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Angelica</i>—Ah! (A pause.) Yes, it is still you! I
am still with you! (A pause. Jean sustains her strongly
and tenderly as they move on into deeper water. Then
their voices are heard from a little distance.) Are you
there, dear Jean?</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Jean</i>—Here I am, Angelica, my beloved!</p>

<p class='c007'>(The current flows strongly in and softly draws the
two lovers onward. They pass out beneath the stone
archway into the full, bright day. As they move from
beneath the sharply-cut outline of the shadow and emerge
into the glow of the level sunset rays, a halo of light seems
to enwreathe the heads of youth and maiden, and their
faces shine as if transfigured. The joyous welcoming
voices come nearer—one can almost understand what
they say! Jean and Angelica float together, buoyed
safely by the current, out into the river. Some pleasure-barges
pass very near, trailing garlands of flowers; the
laughter of the rowers is heard, then the sweet sound dies
along the rippling surface of the water. A fleet messenger-boat
has put forth from the opposite shore and is seen to
thread its way among the myriad river-craft; it approaches;
it stops for a moment in mid-stream. The sun sets;
floods of glory stream out over the city. Evening bells
are heard chiming forth the strains of a triumphant hymn:</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
